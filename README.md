# Read Me First

## Technologies used:
- Java 11


## To run the code:
```
./gradlew run
```

## Assumptions and Considerations:
- a quick and simple application to test log parsing using stream
- no unit tests was added since this is just a test
- log file format doesn't change (eg. first word assumed is IP address, URL captured is before keyword HTTP/1.1)
